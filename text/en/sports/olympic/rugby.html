<p>Rugby originated in the English city of the same name, and is played with an oval ball which possesses an unpredictable bounce. There are seven players on each side (hence Rugby Sevens) and this sport will be making its debut at Rio 2016. The pitch is similar in shape to a football pitch, but that is where the comparison ends. The goals are H-shaped and players can use their hands and feet.</p>
