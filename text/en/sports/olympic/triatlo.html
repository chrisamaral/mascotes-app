<p>This endurance sport combines swimming, cycling and running. The men and women competing in this super-challenge cannot relax for even a minute between one activity and the next. However, they are allowed to drink water as long as they keep moving. You can even lose points if you start running while still wearing your cycling helmet. Get a move on!</p>
