<p>This is really heavy entertainment! Weightlifting is an ancient pastime, and became a professional sport at the end of the nineteenth century. Athletes show their incredible strength by lifting a steel bar loaded with weights (discs) up and over their heads. The sport was opened up to women weightlifters for the first time at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Powerful drama!</p>
