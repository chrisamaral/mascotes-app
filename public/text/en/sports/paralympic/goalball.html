<p>Goalball was conceived especially for blind and visually impaired people. Two teams, each of three athletes, throw a ball to each other in an attempt to score goals. The ball contains a bell and has holes in the outer shell so that players can hear the sound, detect where the ball is and go on the attack or defend their own half.</p>
