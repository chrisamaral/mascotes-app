<p>This is a mixed competition with both men and women players in the same team. Since there is a lot of contact, the game requires modified, robust and reinforced wheelchairs. There are even special models for attacking and defending! A volleyball is used in this game, and it is played on a court similar to that used for basketball. A sport for those in search of radical entertainment.</p>
