<p>Rackets, shuttlecocks, a net and a lot of training are what you need to play this sport of hair-trigger responses and agility!

The shuttlecock is the real star of the show: lightweight with goose-feather flights, it can leave the racket at speeds similar to those seen on the Grand Prix track!</p>
