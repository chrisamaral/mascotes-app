<p>This was the first team sport at the Olympic Games. Players say that water polo is a bit like playing rugby in a swimming pool. There are 13 players to a team but only seven are allowed in the water at any given time. The pool format is different; there are goalmouths at each end but the men’s and women’s pools differ in size. Entertainment guaranteed! Take the plunge!</p>
