<p>In ancient times, rowing provided a means of transport. Nowadays it is hot competition at the Olympic Games. There are individual and team events, with two, four and eight rowers. Teams of eight (known as ‘eights’) also include the coxswain (or just ‘cox’), who shouts out the rowing pace to keep the team in time. With competition distances stretching to 2,000 metres, rowers know exactly what it means to be all in the same boat.</p>
